# StatProject
This project is part of Statistics for Computer Engineering Applications at Kasetsart University.

The instructions for the project and the format of the report are given by the instructor.

In order to answer the question in the report, the instructor wanted us to show the graph and try to find insight from the data.

In this project, the coding language and the library used are Python (numpy,Pandas,seaborn,matplotlib) to analyze and plot all data.

All results are in the report file.

All the data are from the instructor, so I can't publish the data.
