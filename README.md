# StatProject
This project is part of 01204314 Statistics for Computer Engineering Applications at Kasetsart University.

The instruction of the project, and the format of the report are given by the instructor.

In order to answer the question from the report, the instructor required us to show the graph and try finding the insight from the data.

In this project the coding language and the library used are Python(numpy,pandas,seaborn,matplotlib) to analyze and plot all data.

All results are in the report file.

All the data are from the instructor Asst. Prof. Dr. Supaporn Erjongmanee So I can't publish the data.
